Make a mini-parser for the instruction set, so that you can define the gene-space

It should be a 256-entry lut
generated by repeating the user-supplied gene-space string as many times as it'll fit (to be uniformly distributed)

the gene-space string should have the following format:
`[a-z]<(m<..n>)>`
where <> indicates an optional component

* `[a-z]` is a letter corresponding to an instruction
* `(n)` is a base-16 integer corresponding to the instruction subset OR
    * `(m:n)` indicates a linear range from m to n as in (m..=n) in Rust

So a valid string might be
`qafe(3)e(1..12)c(2)`

the color `c()` can accept hex values?
