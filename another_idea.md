What if we wanted to approximate the shapes of objects using this method?
Well, we could use survival of the fittest for some fit function prioritizing even distribution of points inside of the object

A simpler, first version might just compare distance to object center until inside of the object, at which point the score would be uniform throughout (resulting in uneven distribution of points, but it'll look neato anyway
